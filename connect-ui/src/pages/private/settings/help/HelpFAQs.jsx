            answer: "Our algorithm pairs you with available users based on your preferences like age, gender interest, and language. Just click 'Start Chat' to get matched instantly."
        },
        {
            question: "Why am I not getting matched with anyone?",
            answer: "This can happen if your match preferences are too narrow or if no one is currently online. Try adjusting your filters or try again later."
        },
        {
            question: "Can I skip or next a user?",
            answer: "Yes, during a chat session, click the 'Next' button to leave the current chat and get matched with a new user immediately."
        },
        {
            question: "Is my chat history saved?",

        {
            question: "How can I change my gender interest or language preference?",

        },
        {
            question: "How do I report someone for inappropriate behavior?",
            answer: "During a chat, click the 'Report' icon. Select a reason and submit. Reports are anonymous, and our moderation team takes action when necessary."
        },
        {
            question: "Can I disable location-based matching?",
            answer: "Yes. In your settings under Match Preferences, toggle 'Global Matching' to ignore nearby-only matches and connect with users worldwide."
        },
        {
            question: "How do I delete my account?",

        },
        {
            question: "Why was I suddenly disconnected from a chat?",
            answer: "This may happen if the other user ended the chat or if there was a temporary network issue. You can click 'Next' to reconnect with a new user."

            question: "Is this platform safe and moderated?",
